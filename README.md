# OpenGL Fancy Trees

> A beginner example project that displays and interacts with fancy trees.

## How to Run Program in Terminal

1. Clone or download the repo
2. Inside fancytrees folder, run `make` command
3. Type `./main`

## What it Looks Like

If you choose the twoTriangles\_V1 program, you should see an image of three fancy trees. To cycle through different colors/patterns, press '1' repeatedly for the left tree, press '2' repeatedly for the middle tree, and press '0' repeatedly for the right tree. Press '3' repeatedly to cycle through different colors/patterns for the border surrounding the trees.
